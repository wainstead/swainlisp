* Items to work on at a later date vis Emacs
** TODO Try eshell for tailing log files instead of bash
** TODO When I hit compile, focus should return to the current buffer.
** TODO Try the Emacs command that watches a file for updates (found via stackoverflow I think)
** TODO Get the layout of the frame holding the log buffers right, on startup
** TODO There are two versions of sw-tail-logs-meta now, consolidate
** TODO Only four of the five buffers display in a window when I run sw-tail-nfmc-logs :bug:
** TODO Get prompted for every buffer "Kill process?" when sw-kill-nfmc-logs :bug:
** TODO Rewrite sw-tail-logs-meta to take a function argument
Currently, the alist passed to this function provides strings that
become the argument to 'tail -f'. This is not flexible enough. There
is a note where to do this in ssc.el's copy of sw-tail-logs-meta.
** TODO ipython in Emacs is broken
*** TODO The command history gets "globalized" somehow, and sql statements appear in the histories of psql, cli, etc
*** TODO On startup the file ipython.el doesn't seem to load the first time (sometimes not the second)
*** TODO Sometimes a weird error about 'olors' shows upp
** TODO Write a proper Cheetah mode maybe
** TODO psql is not being saved to .emacs.shellbuffers.
** TODO Bug: sw-tail-nfmc-logs only opens three buffers in the new frame but it does start four.
** TODO Use one of the Git modes to speed up work...
Find a way to do "git log (current buffer)" since that's broken in
Emacs. The main problem is using Git means I need to reload the files,
and currently I hit F13 to run a macro I wrote to get around this problem.
** TODO Still not using flymake and bretheren for on-the-fly syntax checking
** TODO Save the shell buffer, not just its contents
desktop-auto-save can save the plain text of the buffer and that's
fine, but Miles Bader clued me to a way to actually save the contents
of the buffer (via buffer-string) to a file... when Emacs starts up a
buffer, then, like "cli," it could "reconstitute" the original buffer
contents. This means the kill ring, command history, location of the
prompts and so on would all work again between invocations of the
buffer.
** TODO Finish Dismiss all "popups"
This makes all buffers whose names start with an asterisk to
vanish... like *Occur*, *Help* and so on.

** Revisit sw-tail-logs-meta
Passing in a filename to tail is not flexible enough; the spawned
shell should be able to do anything... it might not, in the future, be
tailing a log.

(This entry also included:

  "In this case start.dev shouldn't be run automatically, though I think
  the reason was it might already be running; hmm. start.dev should be
  spawned in such a way that when the parent shell goes away
  (i.e. quitting Emacs) it can be reclaimed when the shell start.dev
  starts again, like doing a screen -r.

" 

But I've largely solved this by using GNU screen and Terminal to run
start.dev).

* Items from my old TODO list in swainlib.el:
;;;;;;;;; TODO

;; a command that uses a regular expression to comment out all
;; matching lines. Should use the commenting convention of the current
;; mode (possibly: use cursor movement commands this way: match
;; line. Move cursor to beginning of statement. Set mark. Move cursor
;; to end of statement. Comment region.

;; When I use F8 to find file at point, first put the cursor back to
;; point max before switching to the new file.

;; I still need lisp to self-truncate a buffer. That is, when program
;; output in shell mode is excessive, turn off font lock mode and keep
;; the buffer size under a certain limit.

;; M-x comint-truncate-buffer This command truncates the shell buffer
;; to a certain maximum number of lines, specified by the variable
;; comint-buffer-maximum-size. Here's how to do this automatically
;; each time you get output from the subshell:

;;               (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions
;;                         'comint-truncate-buffer)


;; for desktop-auto-save, defvar a flag variable t or null that tells
;; us whether we've already written out a file. If it's null, test to
;; see if the file is there; if it is, prompt the user yes or no if we
;; can overwrite it.

* Done
** DONE Get *compilation* buffer to stay put somewhere
   CLOSED: [2012-02-28 Tue 12:33]
It would be nice to have this buffer in its own frame somewhere, and
when I run F5 compilation can be viewed in that buffer it that
frame... unfortunately a new buffer always opens in the active frame.
Probably: when tapping "f5" the following should happen:
*** create/raise/switch to frame "compilation" (which is elsewhere, another monitor perhaps)
*** start compilation
