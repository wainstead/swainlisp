Sorry for the emptyother mail.  Try M-x customize-group RET ansi-color
RET.  There is a vector with the color names used somewhere in that
buffer.  Personally, I use cornflowerblue instead of blue.  :)

The marker comint-last-output-start seems to be unset at this point.
Try to add a (setq comint-last-output-start (point-min-marker))
to shell-mode-hook, perhaps.  Untested.  :)  I think this is a bug
somewhere in comint.el, perhaps you should report it via normal
channels, too?
